i3-alternating-layout
=====================

Scripts to open new windows in i3wm using alternating layouts (splith/splitv) for each new window. These scripts were made for [/u/ke7ofi](http://www.reddit.com/user/ke7ofi) after she/he asked a question on how to do this [you can read the question here](http://www.reddit.com/r/i3wm/comments/1sdc39/alternating_horizontal_and_vertical_splitting/).

Installation
------------

### Debian/Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install x11-utils python-pip git
sudo pip install i3-py
git clone https://github.com/olemartinorg/i3-alternating-layout
```
And add ```alternating_layouts.py``` to your ```~/.i3/config``` autostart:
```
exec --no-startup-id /path/to/alternating_layouts.py
```

### Arch Linux
Install [xorg-utils](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/xorg-utils/) from the official repos and [python2-i3-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python2-i3-git) from the AUR.

Then add `exec --no-startup-id python2 /path/to/alternating_layouts.py` to your `~/.i3/config`.

----------

Using regular i3, creating a window layout like this would involve a lot of ```$mod+Return```, ```$mod+h``` and ```$mod+v```. Using this script, you only need to open a bunch of new windows!
